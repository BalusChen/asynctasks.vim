## Features

As vim 8.0 released in 2017, we have got many wonderful plugins like: LSP, DAP and  asynchronous linters. Even things like [vimspector](https://github.com/puremourning/vimspector) which could only been imagined in emacs now exist in vim's community.

But vim is still lack of an elegent system to build/run your project. A lot of people are still dealing with building/running tasks in such a primitive way.

Therefor, I decide to create this plugin by introducing vscode's task like machanisms to vim.
